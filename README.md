# No BS Techbook

Us humans learn many things, unfortunately we forget most of it. This book is a no bullshit reference
for 'tech' related tasks that I once learned, but presumably will forget. Its intent is to be clear, 
succinct, and not to provide fluffly content that you'll probably never need anyways. It is in no way exhaustive
or deliberately comprehensive (though I hope one day it may be), and is currently a work in progress.

Either way, hopefully one or two of the articles come in handy for any passers-by.

## Usage

The techbook is created with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), which can be installed with *cargo*: `cargo install mdbook`.

Otherwise, to view it in all it's glory, clone it, build it, and serve it.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:brahste/no-bs-techbook.git
$ cd no-bs-techbook
$ mdbook build
$ mdbook serve
```
