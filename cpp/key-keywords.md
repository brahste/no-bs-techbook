# Key Keywords in C++

__typedef__ & __using__

Short for _type definition_, this keyword allows the user to create new names for types. It is commonly used in C++ to redefine template types.

Usage:
```c++
typedef existing_type new_type;
```
a more recent addition to create type aliases in C++ is the `using` keyword.

Usage:
```c++
using new_type_name = existing_type;
```
