In agile, a __spike__ is a type of user story that is meant to determine the amount of effort required to implement a new feature, development practice, or change. Once a spike is complete, it is typical that the outcomes of the spike are broken into further stories. 

Backlog refinement?

There are four main cases when spikes should be used:

1. When there are several potential ways to complete a task. In this case the development team needs to explore the options and determine which one is optimal for their situation.
2. When the development team doesn't know whether a proposed solution will work or provide the intended result.
3. When the team doesn't know how to solve a problem.
4. When the time estimate of a new feature or solution is unknown and some exploration needs to be done to understand the time-cost.
