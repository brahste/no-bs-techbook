Design documents are crucial during the development of new software systems: they clarify the intention behind a new software's design, give direction to the development process, and expose data structures, dependencies, and requirements that may not be apparent.

# What to Include 

1. __Title, Author, Date of Last Update__
2. __Brief__: Summary of the problem, solution, scope, and impact
3. __Context and Problem Statement__: Summary of why the new system is needed and (if applicable) the shortcomings of the current implementation.
4. __Requirements__: Implementation agnostic requirements that the system must satisfy
5. __Milestones__
6. __Proposed Solution__: This is the most detailed section of the document and should include diagrams
7. __Considerations on Proposed Solution__: This should outline alternative solutions, potential blockers in the development process, and any open questions pertaining to the proposed solution.
8. __Testability__: How can the solution be tested, both at a component and integration level?
9. __Detailed Scoping and Timeline__
