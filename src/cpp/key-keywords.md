# Key Keywords in C++

### typedef & using

Short for _type definition_, this keyword allows the user to create new names for types. It is commonly used in C++ to redefine template types.

Usage:

```c++
typedef existing_type new_type;
```

a more recent addition to create type aliases in C++ is the `using` keyword.

Usage:

```c++
using new_type_name = existing_type;
```
