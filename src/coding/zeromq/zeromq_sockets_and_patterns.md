# ZeroMQ Sockets and Patterns

> Note: the `zmq_send()` function is bad at dealing with messages of arbitrary or unknown size. The `zmq_msg_send()` function is better at this, though uses a more difficult API.
> To get the best understanding of how messages are used/passed in ZeroMQ using the *zmq_msg_t* structure, refer to Chp. 2 of the ZeroMQ Guide on *Working with Messages*.
